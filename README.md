## Special Stage Archive

This is an archive of files related to Special Stage Systems, mostly culled from files saved to web.archive.org.

Missing files:

- `Micro-Edit-1.0-MAC.zip`
- `Micro-Edit-1.0-WIN.zip`
- `Ming-Micro-MIDI-Implementation.pdf`
- `Ming-Micro-DIY.zip`

I don't actually own either a Ming Mecca or a Ming Micro but figured a central place to share these files would be useful to the larger community.

I am in the market for used versions of either product; email me at <a href="mailto:beau@beaugunderson.com">beau@beaugunderson.com</a>.
